2. css :nth-child() selector -  The :nth-child(n) selector matches every element that is the nth child, regardless of type, of its parent.
3. css :last-child selector / :first-child() selecetor - The :last-child selector matches every element that is the last child of its parent. / The :first-child selector matches every element that is the first child of its parent.
4. css transform: translateY - Defines a translation, using only the value for the Y-axis.
5. JavaScript :   The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the specified element / if alse statement .
  
  How worsk JS in the project:
  
  Ther is a const panels what contains the all HTML panel.
  Then the next step is a toggleOpen function which contains a this.classList.toggle('open') code . This code adds the open class to element which we click on.
  And then the next is a toggleActive function which contains an if statement which decides the e.propertyName.includes('flex') and then it is true then it gives a toggle classList which is open-active .
  And more ther are two forEach() method which contain addEventListener() methods.
